        My Dear Laya,<br>
        I'm not very thoughtful or creative like you, but I know how much gestures mean to you, so I decided to do something I'm not bad at 😅😅

        <br><br>
        It's only been a month since I met you, and yet we've become so close 😮. I never thought I'd be able to love someone so much in so less time.
        You're really amazing. <br>You have so much pain
        inside and yet you're the 🔆 brightest 🔆face on the outside, bringing joy to everyone around you. And for that, I can't tell you how much I respect
        you. You're incredibly talented and can achieve anything 🥇you set your mind on. You've taken such good care of me, like my mother would have if 
        she was still here. I'm sure she would have loved you 💜   <br><br>All the moments we've spent together over the past few weeks feel so surreal 😲. <br> 
        I love the way you talk 🗣, the way you smile 😊, the way you sing 🎶, the way you're so matured, and yet so childish 👶🏻 when you're with me.
        I really love that and I hope it never changes. I love your eyes 👀, I love how cute you are 🩵, even when you're angry 😤. <br>
        I'll do everything I can to take such good care of you that you'll forget all your worries and be happy and peaceful with me 😇.
        I know I'm not very expressive 😶 and may not always show it, but I really love you. 
        If you ask how much, I'd say I love you less than tomorrow 💕💕. 
        Please know that you're not alone anymore and I'm here for you, whatever you need. 
        I don't really care about the concept of valentines day because you're special to me every single day. But since it means something to you,
        here I am trying to do something, not even sure what I'm doing lol😅. So please don't hate me even if this ends up looking like shit 🥹.
        You came into my depressed and hopeless life and brought in so much of light and happiness. I can never thank you enough for that.
        I hope we stay together in our journey moving forward and that we'll stand side by side, holding each others hands 👫.
        <br>With lots of love, your Vardhana.
